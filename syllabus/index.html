<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>This course is about the roots of revolution in 20th-century Latin America. It is about heroic individuals and almost-immovable structures. It is about moments of historical contingency and long term historical processes. It is about domestic and international elites and revolutionaries. Using the life and afterlife of Ernesto "Che" Guevara, we will examine 20th-century Latin American history with an eye to the question, "If, when, and how did armed revolution become a rational response to Latin American reality?"<br />
</p>
<p>We will examine ideologies of economic development and revolutionary action that helped define the region. We will look at specific moments that intersected Ernesto Guevara's life, from Peronist Argentina to Guatemala '54 to Cuba '59 to Bolivia '67, and his afterlife of hopeful image and crass commodity.  In order to do this, we will hone our skills as historians, engaging difficult texts within the context of their making. We will read <strong>a lot</strong>. That is, at its most quotidian, what historians do.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Course objectives:</strong><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To introduce students to important some important moments in the history of development and revolution in post-WWII Latin America.<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students better understand the relationship between important historical concepts such as agency and structure, culture and power.<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students understand some historical approaches to asking and answering questions, including:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>How to identify, closely read, and analyze primary sources.<br />
</li>
<li>How to work with and evaluate useful secondary sources, specifically identifying and evaluating their central arguments.<br />
</li>
<li>How to work with non-written sources (including images and artifacts).<br />
</li>
<li>To understand and appreciate ambiguity in historical argument and presentation.<br />
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage students to hone their skills at collaboratively posing and solving problems.<br />
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>nota bene:</strong> This is a participation-intensive class. It is imperative that each week you do the reading and follow through with your part of preparing for class. Class sessions are devoted to discussions of our readings and the broader issues, theoretical and empirical, raised by those sources. We will be meeting once a week, and much of your work will be done outside of class. The burden of time management is thus on you.</p>

As we meet just once per week, each student is allowed one (1)  absence for any reason. As part of the participation grade, each class meeting students are required to bring a short news summary related to Latin America. The best news summaries will connect in some way to issues covered in the class. There are news sources available on the [course site](/news, though students are not restricted just to those sources. I will collect short summaries at the beginning of each class.</p>
